## Project Overview
Colorado board of directors presented a task to complete election audit for the congressional 

    1. Total votes cast
    2. Complete list of candidates who received votes    
    3. % votes each candidate won 
    4. Total number of votes for each candidate
    5. Winner of election
  
  The election commission has requested some additional data to complete the audit:

The voter turnout for each county
The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
The county with the highest turnout
Working from this module’s election_results.csv file, use for loops and conditional statements with membership and logical operators to find the requested results. Then, print the results to the command line and save them to your election_results.txt file.

Finally, you’ll provide a written analysis of the election audit for the election commission, including the new results and a clearly written overview of your methods. As with all written analyses, this will help your audience understand what you did and what they might be able to do with the data you presented.
